# Password Generator Challenge

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The aim of this project was to create an app that would generate a random
password based on users given parameters (e.g. password lenght, password case etc..)

This project makes use of functions to pick random characters from a series of arrays and then uses these selections to populate a final array that it then used as the password.  

I became more familiar with the use of arrays and functions during this work.
